                      <h2>Materials and Construction</h2>

                      <p>French Colonial homes are constructed using a variety of materials, including brick, wood, and stucco. The choice of materials often reflects the local resources available and the need for durability in a challenging climate. The use of these materials, combined with the home’s elegant proportions and detailing, creates a distinctive and charming appearance.</p>

                      <h2>Interior Features</h2>

                      <p>The interiors of French Colonial homes are designed to be both functional and elegant.
