The word "bungalow" comes from the Bengali term "bangla," which described small, single-story homes with low-pitched roofs, deep overhangs and large verandas, designed to provide shelter from the region’s heat and heavy monsoon rains.

British officials, soldiers and expatriates stationed in India began adopting these bungalow-style homes for their own use, appreciating the simplicity and comfort they offered. When the British brought this architectural influence back to England it was adapted for coastal and countryside vacation homes. The design became especially popular for seaside retreats, as its open layout, wide porches, and connection to nature were ideal for leisure and relaxation. The popularity of bungalows continued to spread, eventually becoming a part of suburban development in England and the U.S.

                        The American Craftsman movement, led by architects like Gustav Stickley and inspired by the  Arts and Crafts<sup>1</sup> movement, embraced the simplicity, functionality, and handcrafted quality of bungalow houses.
