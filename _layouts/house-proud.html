                              Homeowners Jaisen and Rachel are Cincinnati natives but moved to California shortly after getting married and lived there for 16 years. The pandemic and a surprise edition of twins helped put into perspective the many benefits of living close to family. When looking for a Cincy home they chose Wyoming because of the central location, great schools and beautiful homes.

                              Colonial style homes originated when settlers came to North America and rose to popularity because they could be built quickly to protect from the outside elements. The buildings are typically rectangular and symmetrical with small windows made of several panes of glass and gabled roofs. 

                              This style experienced an architectural revival in the 1800s by adding Victorian-era stylings such as ornate moldings, porticos and larger windows. Colonial Revivals had a boom after WW2 when soldiers came back from Europe proudly wanting to build houses uniquely American.

                              True to Colonial style, the main building of this brick home has a strong sense of symmetry most notably seen in the alignment of the windows and the centrally located front door. There is a second front door and porch on the smaller adjoining building. The second entrance serves as a more casual entrance for the family’s daily use, deliveries, etc. Historically single family homes had a second front door for a variety of reasons. It could have been that the formal entrance was reserved for business or meetings that took place  in the more formal parts of the house more accessible from the formal entrance. The second front door could have been used for housekeepers or it could have been used for ventilation purposes.

                              The shape and style of the front porch are a notable departure from Colonial styles which typically have a portico. Porticos are different from porches because they are not intended to be used as living space. Rather, they are only meant to provide cover at the entrance or exit of a house. A porch generally has more space and can accommodate a rocking chair or a table and chairs set. The soft arch recessed porch adds variety to the rectangular windows and brings something unique to this Colonial Revival. Our homeowner Rachel enjoys minimalist style and often contemplates removing the shutters of the house for more of a “Saltbox Colonial” feel which has a minimalist aesthetic. If this home were to have a traditional portico she would not be itching to remove the shutters.

                              A debate the couple often has is whether or not to paint the brick. Initially Rachel thought they would paint the brick but Jaisen loves it and fears once painted it would be hard to restore to a brick facade. Rachel, an interior designer, argues that a painted house would add contrast bringing more attention to the building itself as she feels it currently blends too much into the surroundings. However there are so many painted brick houses that she appreciates the original brick feeling fresh and unexpected.

                              Colonial floor plans are typically laid out with rooms stacked on top of each other because it was helpful in heating the house in times that pre-date HVAC systems. A centrally located fireplace is typical as well as fireplaces on each end of the house (as is the case in this home) as they were the main source of heat for the home. The modern, energy efficient windows here have a colonial grid that mimics original colonial windows which were made of individual panes of glass. Colonists initially had it sent from Europe which made glass expensive and made it nearly impossible to get them in large panes.

                              Upon opening the front door you will see a curved grand staircase and long hallway which are consistent with the design of a “center hall colonial” house. Staircases are not only curved to create an elegant look. They occupy less space compared to straight stairs of the same height. In this case, the slight curve of the stairs allows for more floor space in the entry.

                              The left side of the house has a spacious powder bath and coat closet just off the entry. Beyond that through a small hallway is a room the previous owners used as a bar, with custom cabinetry, a prep sink, exhaust fan and wine fridge. When touring the house the real estate agent referred to the room as the “Cigar Room'' presumably because one of the previous owners smoked cigars there.  Because Jaisen and Rachel seldom smoke cigars and do not drink alcohol enough to have a dedicated bar area they decided to re-brand the room, calling it the “music room” and using it as a spot for Jaisen to lounge and listen to his favorite records and their daughter to take her weekly zoom voice lessons. Guitar and Ukelele’s hang on the wall beckoning someone to come pick them up and play for a bit. The custom cabinetry is being put to good use storing the family’s china, some glassware and other things needed for entertaining as well as some alcohol ;)

                              To the right of the entry is the formal dining room, a room the family uses daily. It was one of the first rooms Rachel made changes to by switching out the traditional crystal chandelier to one a bit more modern, painting the walls and adding applied moldings below the existing chair rail. The traditional Queen Anne style table paired with the modern mid century style dining chairs is an example of the overall aesthetic goal of Modern Traditional style. This room as well as the majority of the house is a work in progress but Rachel is excited to execute the vision she had when initially seeing the house last year. Many of her favorite spaces have a traditional base with modern elements and this Colonial Revival is the perfect canvas to bring her vision to life.

                              Rather than limiting the use of the formal living room as an overflow space or a room to use when entertaining, Jaisen and Rachel considered how their family likes to watch TV and movies together and opted to use the formal living room area routinely for that. They purchased a snuggly soft double chaise sofa with enough space for the whole family to cuddle in and stream the latest episodes of their favorite shows or a movie or watch their beloved (though currently a bit troubled) Warriors play basketball. To brighten up the room the couple painted the walls Benjamin Moore’s White Dove.   Rachel loves the curves of the Empire style antique hutch which showcases her collection of white geometric shaped pottery- another pairing of modern and traditional design.

Adjacent to the living room is a screened porch that overlooks the woods behind the house. The family often uses this space for morning coffee and a second spot for the kids to watch TV when their younger and older children want to independently watch their own aged shows. It’s one of their favorite rooms in the house and they bring blankets out in the winter so they can get more use out of it.Access to  the screened in porch is made available through two entrances. One from the living room and the other from the sunroom.

Currently, the sunroom is set up with homework stations for the two oldest children who are in middle school.  A sofa provides an alternative to sitting at either of the desks. This sofa is not something Rachel would have seen herself liking so much in her own home and it has a funny story behind it. The former owner left the sofa behind because it is heavy to move and it must not have been needed where they were going. Rachel was the only one at the house the day the movers came and there was literally nowhere else to sit being that the house was otherwise empty of furniture. Though the sofa is a very traditional style Rachel fell in love with how comfy it is. It’s a deep sofa that is perfect for pulling your legs up and to the side, just the way she likes to sit. It is the best place in the house for reading.

Rachel and Jaisen have toddler aged twins. When purchasing this home they had a concern with the tall windows at the back of the house because the house sits on a slope that makes the windows at the back at least two stories high and the windows sit about 9” from the finished floor so they needed to find creative ways to distract the twins from the windows. In the sunroom, this second hand sofa blocks access to the windows. The twins might not even know they are there. This position of the sofa also keeps a clear path to the screened porch and is more conversationally connected to the larger living room.
