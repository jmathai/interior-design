Wyoming Ohio has a good reputation for a few reasons. First of course is the consistently well rated local schools offering residents a great public education option. Second, might be the prime location having easy access to downtown Cincinnati as well as surrounding suburbs. It could also be the beautiful homes that fill Wyoming’s lots. Lower commute time is great but for me, a proud homebody, it’s definitely Wyoming’s beautiful homes.

Have you ever driven down or walked through a beautiful street in Wyoming full of charming houses and wondered if there is a story behind the charm? In Wyoming, there is inspiration on nearly every corner. Maybe you own a home in need of renovations and would love to see how a neighbor solved a particular design dilemma. Maybe you’ve already painstakingly renovated your Wyoming home and would love to show it off.

                            House Proud, Wyoming is the blog for you! Born out of appreciation for the wonderful and diverse architecture of Wyoming Ohio and the beautifully manicured landscapes. It is a place to inspire and to be inspired. Come along with me as I share up close and personal details of the wonderful Wyoming homes we’re all dying to see more of.

                            To foster turning inspiration into reality, we’ve created mood boards, based on the homes featured here on House Proud. They contain direct links to products used by the homeowner or to similar products available online. They are not sponsored, and I do not earn a commission. They are completely free to use!
