After years of living on Cincinnati’s west side and when her kids chose to settle in other neighborhoods, homeowner April started looking to relocate to be closer to them and to be more actively involved with her grandkids. She found a wonderful Craftsman Bungalow on Grove, just a few minutes away from her daughter’s home in Wyoming.

April wasn’t initially focused on Wyoming. Her house hunt took her through Woodlawn, Evendale, Blue Ash, Montgomery and other nearby areas.  However, when she visited Wyoming, she was impressed by the lively neighborhood atmosphere. She noticed kids were riding their bikes in the neighborhood, something she didn’t see elsewhere. The walkability of Wyoming was also an appeal. She particularly likes that she lives so close to the Wyoming Avenue shops although she jokes about the temptation of the nearby Wyoming Pastry Shop. Personally, I’m partial to their Cherry Bismark donut. April told me her favorite is the Chocolate Covered with White Filling. Yum!
                            </p>
                            <p>
In addition to strolling through the neighborhood, Wyoming provides plenty of opportunities to stay active (and burn off the calories from the Pastry Shop’s treats). With programs at the Rec Center, public pickleball courts, and the nearby Powel Crosley YMCA, there are numerous ways to get your steps in. April enjoys taking full advantage of these amenities to keep herself active and engaged.

                            <h2>Did you know the Bungalow has roots in India?</h2>
                            <p>
The word "bungalow" comes from the Bengali term "bangla," which described small, single-story homes with low-pitched roofs, deep overhangs and large verandas, designed to provide shelter from the region’s heat and heavy monsoon rains.
                            </p>
                            <p>
British officials, soldiers and expatriates stationed in India began adopting these bungalow-style homes for their own use, appreciating the simplicity and comfort they offered. When the British brought this architectural influence back to England it was adapted for coastal and countryside vacation homes. The design became especially popular for seaside retreats, as its open layout, wide porches, and connection to nature were ideal for leisure and relaxation. The popularity of bungalows continued to spread, eventually becoming a part of suburban development in England and the U.S.
                            </p>
                            <p>
The American Craftsman movement, led by architects like Gustav Stickley and inspired by the  Arts and Crafts movement, embraced the simplicity, functionality, and handcrafted quality of bungalow houses.

                            <h2>Architectural Features of a Craftsman House</h2>
                            <p>
Craftsman houses are known for their low-pitched, gabled roofs with wide, unenclosed eave overhangs and roof rafters that are often exposed, sometimes with decorative beams or braces frequently added under the gables. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
Porches, whether full or partial width, are typically supported by tapered or square columns that extend to ground level although some variants, like April’s Craftsman on Grove Avenue, feature columns that rest on the porch floor. Sometimes, the roof of the porch is created by the wide overhanging eaves and a continuation of the main roof of the house. The below graphic shows typical Craftsman style porch supports and variants. You can see other types of Craftsman roof styles here.
                            </p>
                            <p>
Most Craftsman homes are one and a half stories tall with a centered dormer on the roof creating more usable space in the attic level. Two-story Craftsman homes can be found as well with full width porches being common in this variation. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
The 3-over-1 windows are a hallmark of the Craftsman style. Unlike Colonial windows, which feature both vertical and horizontal window trim pieces, Craftsman windows have only vertical trim, echoing the simple, but elegant aspect of the design.
                            </p>
                            <p>
One-third of all Craftsman houses share the same style as this one on Grove: a side-gabled roof, a central dormer, and a full-width porch. This style is very common in the Northeast and Midwest.

                            <h2>Simplicity, Functionality and Hand-Crafted Nature</h2>
                            <p>
Craftsman style, emerging from the Arts and Crafts movement of the early 20th century, is celebrated for its emphasis on simplicity, functionality, and a handcrafted nature. It championed the idea that creating well-made, simple goods contributed to a more honest and ethical society, encouraging individuals to learn a craft and produce their own work. This philosophy extended to home building when manufacturers made it possible for working and middle-class families to build their own homes using pre-packaged kits.
                            </p>
                            <p>
From 1908 to 1930, Sears and Roebuck sold 70,000 of these kit homes through mail-order catalogs. They promised that an average person could assemble a Sears kit home in about 90 days. No detail was overlooked. Sears homes were shipped with 75 page instruction books and contained 10,000-30,000 pieces, marked to facilitate construction. Some kits contained up to 750 pounds of nails all marked with correct spacing outlined in the manual. Fine materials were often used such as cypress on the exterior, top grade Southern pine for framing and maple for kitchen and bath floors. Homeowners who chose Sears kits saved, on average, 30% compared to traditional home construction.

                            <h2>How To Tell If Your Home is a Sears Home</h2>
                            <p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Look for stamped lumber on exposed beams, joists and rafters in the basement, crawlspace or attic and check the back of millwork for shipping labels. The lumber was marked on the tall side, 2-10 inches from the end. On shipping labels, lood for the Sears and Roebuck address in Chicago, IL.</li>
                                <li>Check the homes blueprint or layout in an accredited field guide, comparing the house to photos and floor plans shown. Pay special attention to the placement of windows and doors, chimneys, bathroom and kitchen vents, and other elements that are not likely to have moved much. Look for these things to match perfectly. If not, you might not have a Sears kit home. </li>
                                <li>Evaluate building materials. Sears pedestal sinks were marked “R” and “SR” was marked on kitchen sinks. Look on the underside, near the front. On bathtubs, look in the lower corner, on the side furthest from the tub spout. Another clue is in the sheetrock. If it says “goodwall” on the backside, it’s likely a Sears home.  </li>
                                <li>Look for simplified joinery. Sears kits often had plinth blocks where complex joints meet, making it easier for a novice to build. Similarly, Sears used a unique 5 pc eave bracket on the front porch. </li>
                                <li>If your home was not built between 1908-1940 it is not a Sears home as they were only sold during these years. </li>
                              </ul>

                            <h2>Midwest Craftsman Homes Influenced by Prairie School</h2>
                            <p>
In the Midwest, Craftsman-style homes were often influenced by the Prairie School style, which originated in Chicago. The Prairie style emerged in Chicago around 1900, led by a group of young architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright. These architects combined the ideals of the Arts and Crafts movement—emphasizing nature, craftsmanship, and simplicity—into their designs. In some ways, April’s Craftsman seems to take a simplified approach to the design style which is why I think there was influence from the contemporary Prairie style. Notably, there are no exposed rafters or decorative brackets at the roof of the porch or at the gabled dormer roof which was very common in traditional Craftsman homes. Also, the porch columns are not typical of the Craftsman style; instead of short columns resting above the porch floor, they are tall, made of one material and extend to the ceiling of the roof. This was only seen in about 20% of Craftsman homes nationally but it is more common here in the Midwest.

                            <h2>Craftsman Interiors</h2>
                            <p>
The Craftsman ideal of simplicity and functionality extended into the interiors of Craftsman homes. These spaces embraced a more understated elegance than the lavish details seen in earlier Victorian architecture. Plain wood floors, small woven rugs, and exposed beam ceilings were common features. Walls were often divided by moldings and painted, and when wallpaper was used, it was typically confined to the frieze, not the entire wall. The frieze is a decorative band or panel. similar to what we know as a wallpaper "border." In Craftsman-style interiors it was a larger band than what you are probably remembering from your parents circa 1988 kitchen. If Craftsman style is your thing and you'd like to incorporate wallpaper and a frieze, consider this colorful and happy  pattern or maybe something a bit more refined and less bold.
                            </p>
                            <p>
Dining rooms featured high wainscoting and a dish rail, and color palettes tended to be muted. Built-in furniture was a hallmark of the style, particularly near fireplaces and in dining room nooks. Small stained glass windows, hammered copper lighting, and decorative glazed tiles—such as Cincinnati’s own Rookwood Pottery tiles—were also prevalent.
                            </p>
                            <p>
Craftsman furniture was simplified and straightforward in design, often featuring large, thick elements with exposed joinery, reflecting the honesty in its construction. Most pieces were made of oak, with ammonia fuming commonly used as a staining technique to darken the wood and highlight its grain pattern. Tables were substantial, typically with four thick legs connected by stretchers or sometimes with a trestle base. They came in rectangular, circular, and occasionally octagonal shapes. Exposed joinery was intentional, serving as the decorative detail. Hardware was made of hammered metal, adding to the handcrafted aesthetic.

Gustav Stickley's United Crafts Furniture Co and Elbert Hubbard’s Roycroft Furniture line were among the most popular pieces of Craftsman furniture. Over 120 years later, Stickley Furniture Company is still in business, continuing to emphasize craftsmanship and sustainability as their guiding principles. You can purchase Stickley Furniture locally, at Cincinnati Furniture Fair locations. While Craftsman homes often featured built-in furniture, freestanding pieces like dressers, sideboards, and bookcases remained popular and were widely sold.

April often starts her day sitting in one of the lounge chairs at the bottom of the steps. She likes to sit there and drink coffee while reading the news on her ipad or watching it on the TV. She also has a good viewpoint of the street where she can see neighbors heading off to work and kids walking to school, which reminds her of the sense of community she enjoys in Wyoming.

                            <p>
Upon entering April’s home you’ll find more elements of Craftsman design. The staircase is a prime example and on the far wall of the living room you will find a nice fireplace, flanked by windows.
                            </p>
                            <p>
Built in bookcases under the windows, typical of Craftsman style, were not a part of this home’s original design. We know this because there are large metal grates on the floor that were part of the original heating system, sitting where the bookcases would have been built in.

Before the invention of forced-air heating systems, “gravity exchange systems” were used, which allowed cool air to fall to the basement and hot air from the boiler or furnace to rise up through the grates.Fuel was burned in a combustion chamber which heated the air and rose up in the duct work and through the grates. In this case, the fuel was oil. You can still find the old oil storage tanks in the crawlspace under the front porch which is kinda neat.

The fireplace was originally a wood burning fireplace but April converted it to gas which is cleaner and easier to maintain. It was during this small renovation project that April found out one drawback to having a home that is nearly a century old is that there aren’t a lot of tradesmen who know how to work with old homes. She talked to a few different plumbers about running the gas line to convert the fireplace. When the one she thought she would hire stopped answering her calls she felt frustrated but then she found Karl Mattes who had a more simple and straightforward approach of running the gas line straight from the main and not having to deal with the old house, small basement utility room, and furnace.

From the living room you can access the dining room and kitchen. The floors are the original hardwood floors from 1927. You can see old hardware on the floor between the living room and dining room that is evidence of a previous pocket door.

Most often Craftsman houses have a layout that includes a hallway from the front door directly back into the kitchen. That is not the case here so we suspect there was a previous remodel that sealed the hallway opening. There are no markings on the floors that would indicate any walls have been removed from the living room but there is a change in depth on the wall and some markings on the floor that could be evidence of the hallway being sealed up from the living room to the kitchen.

If this was the case, the small change in the layout accomplished two things: first, it created a larger wall in the living room, which could have been useful for different furniture arrangements; second, it allowed for the kitchen to be expanded.

Thanks to a previous owner’s remodel, April’s kitchen is now larger and more open than the original design likely would have been. It's probable that another doorway was closed off to make room for additional cabinets, and a wall was removed to open the kitchen up to the dining room. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
The large picture window in the dining room floods the space with natural light, while the casement windows April installed work with the adjacent kitchen windows to create a pleasant cross breeze when the weather is nice.

The kitchen itself is a standout feature, offering abundant storage and a bright, open feel. The thoughtful layout of the cabinetry and appliances not only enhances safety but also ensures a comfortable and efficient workspace. With ample space for movement, it’s an ideal kitchen for entertaining, providing both functionality and room for guests to gather when April hosts.

An interesting aspect of this home’s history is that it was once owned by the city of Wyoming and utilized as a rental property. When the city decided to sell, an investor stepped in and undertook extensive renovations. These included the kitchen remodel and an addition of a mudroom and powder room located behind the kitchen, as well as a facelift for the upstairs bathroom and other updates throughout the house.

Adding the powder room has been a significant enhancement to the home, particularly when entertaining. With the other two bathrooms located either upstairs near the bedrooms or in the basement, the powder room offers a much more accessible option for guests who may find stairs challenging. Additionally, it's highly convenient for children who may wait until the last minute and need a restroom close by.

In general, the materials used are of good quality and have a timeless nature. Granite, marble, subway tile, light fixtures and mosaic tile floors that are appropriate for the architecture and kohler products. Not bad for a flip!

Like many Craftsman-style homes, April’s house has upstairs bedrooms. But, what sets it apart is the surprisingly generous closet space for an older home. The primary bedroom boasts ample storage, and even the guest room features two spacious closets. Thinking creatively about how her daughter, who lives in St. Louis, and her family might use the space when they visit, April transformed one of the guest room closets into a cozy sleeping nook for her grandchildren. This thoughtful addition proved incredibly helpful, giving the little ones their own space with a door and light for privacy, while still keeping them close by for their parents. It allowed for a bit of separation, which was ideal while the children kept earlier bedtimes than the adults.
